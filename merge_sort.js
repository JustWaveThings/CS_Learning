/* // merge sort recursive algorithm

level 0  [9, 3, 7, 5, 6, 4, 8, 2]

left side on the way down to the base case

level 1  [9 3 7 5]

level 2  [9 3] [7 5]

level 3  [9] [3]  [7] [5]

left side on the way back up to a sorted left half of input array







level 3     [3Â 9]  [ 5 7]


mergeSort ( low , high) {
    if

1    if ( low  <  high ){
        find midpoint
        call mergeSort on the low to midpoint

2            if ( low < high )
                find midpoint
                    call mergeSort on low to midpoint

3                        if low < high
                            find midpoint
                                call mergesort on low to mid

}







In the 8 digit array, the 3rd level puts each element in its own array. This is the base case. We should then compare the two left arrays and merge them into a two element array low to high, then compare the two remaining arrays and merge them low to high
