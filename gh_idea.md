## Stripped down GitHub Clone

### Description of the project

A **very** stripped down GitHub Clone.

features that *could* be acheivable for JS final project?

My understanding of Git / GitHub is that GitHub is a hosting service for Git repos, and the work of versioning is done by Git. I am not suggesting that this project use or try to recreate Git, just really the GitHub UI with some features that simulate Git.

Things like:

- Create user accounts / profiles
- Create public repository.
  - Web form editor only (think copy paste)
  - allow branching
  - allow simple merging of branches
- Generate a hash for each 'commit'
- Show file diffs ('commit' history)
- Repo commenting system
  - create issues (logged in users)
  - view issues (anyone)
  - close issues (repo owner only)
- Local Storage / Cloud storage through Firebase

Things to exclude:

- Any uploading beyond profile image.
- No cloning or forking repos

Perhaps even a portion of what is above would be appropriate? Maybe generate fake repos and commit histories and limit the user to the repo commenting system.

My Google search for any example of existing student projects came to nil.  Is it unique to say that you made a GitHub Clone?
